# Renan Silva

### Hello World 👋🏾

I'm a **software developer** and enthusiast of everything involving technology, mainly in the areas of systems engineering, systems security, AI and data in general. 🙋🏾‍♂️💻

> "Nothing in the world will take the place of persistence. Talent will not. The world is full of unsuccessful people with talent. Education will not. The world is full of educated derelicts. Genius will not. Unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. The slogan press on has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." - Calvin Coolidge 🙌🏾
